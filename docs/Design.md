# Narwhal Consensus Implementation Design Document

## 1. What is Narwhal Consensus?

Narwhal is a mempool protocol that enables high-throughput transaction dissemination and ordering in blockchain systems. Unlike traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms that bundle transaction dissemination with consensus, Narwhal separates these concerns:

- **Transaction Dissemination**: Handled by Narwhal's DAG-based mempool
- **Consensus**: Can be implemented separately on top of the DAG (e.g., using Bullshark or Tusk)

Key differences from traditional blockchain consensus:
- Transactions are organized in a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of a linear chain
- Parallel processing of transactions improves throughput
- Separation of concerns allows for better scalability
- No immediate finality requirement during dissemination phase

## 2. Key Components Design

### 2.1 Transaction Structure
- Unique identifier (hash-based)
- Transaction data (payload)
- Parent references (DAG edges)
- Validation logic for parent existence

### 2.2 DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
- In-memory storage using HashMap
- Parent-child relationship tracking
- Transaction validation
- State query capabilities
- Concurrent access handling using Tokio mutex

### 2.3 P2P Network Layer
- Built on libp2p framework
- Components:
  - Kademlia DHT for peer discovery
  - Request/Response protocol for transaction propagation
  - Identify protocol for peer information
  - Custom behavior implementation for message handling
- Event-driven architecture using SwarmEvent

### 2.4 HTTP/Axum Endpoints
- `/transaction` (POST): Submit new transactions
- `/dag/state` (GET): Query current DAG state
- Async handlers with shared state
- JSON request/response format

### 2.5 Event Handling
- Swarm event processing for P2P events
- Transaction validation and propagation
- Peer connection management
- Error handling and logging

## 3. Implementation Challenges

### 3.1 Memory Safety
- Challenge: Unsafe channel handling in P2P message processing
- Solution: Proper ownership transfer and validation checks before processing

### 3.2 Concurrent Access
- Challenge: Multiple components accessing shared state
- Solution: Arc<TokioMutex> for safe concurrent access

### 3.3 Parent Validation
- Challenge: Race conditions in parent validation
- Solution: Atomic validation and insertion operations

### 3.4 P2P Message Handling
- Challenge: Complex event handling with multiple protocols
- Solution: Structured event handling with proper error propagation
